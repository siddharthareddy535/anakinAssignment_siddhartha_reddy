Frist install  selenium and import through that scrap the data by driver.get method
by passing url
        from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
        from selenium import webdriver
        from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
        from selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options
        example: driver.get("your link")

After that find the elements for extracting required data
for finding we use driver.find_element(By.CLASS_NAME,"ant-layout").get_attribute("innerHTML")


Analyze the captured data: After capturing the network traffic, you will need to analyze the captured data to extract the product information. Look for requests that contain the product data and extract the relevant information from the response.

Extract product data: Once you have identified the relevant requests, extract the product data by parsing the response and transforming it into a structured format like JSON or CSV.

Store the extracted data: Finally, store the extracted product data in a database or a file for further analysis or processing.
